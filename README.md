## 🚀 Features

- **Modern GUI**: Beautiful, dark-themed Tkinter interface with smooth controls and live status bar.
- **Interactive Maze Builder**: Draw walls, erase, set start/goal with a click. No special mouse buttons needed!
- **Live Animation**: Watch the A* algorithm search and find the optimal path, step by step.
- **Custom or Console Mode**: Use the GUI or enter mazes manually in the console.
- **Fast & Accurate**: Uses the A* algorithm for the shortest path, visualized in real time.
- **Easy to Use**: No setup hassle. Just run and go!

## 🖥️ GUI Controls

- **Draw Wall**: Click to draw black walls.
- **Erase**: Click to erase walls.
- **Set Start**: Click, then click a cell to set the green start.
- **Set Goal**: Click, then click a cell to set the blue goal.
- **Solve**: Watch the AI animate its search and solution.
- **Clear**: Reset the grid instantly.

> **Tip:** The status bar guides you through every step!

## 🧩 How It Works

- **A* Pathfinding**: Combines actual cost and heuristic (Manhattan distance) for blazing-fast, optimal solutions.
- **Visualization**: Yellow = explored, Red = final path, Green = start, Blue = goal.
- **Customizable**: Change grid size, colors, or animation speed in `main.py`.
